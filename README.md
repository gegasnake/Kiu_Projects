# KIU Projects
Welcome to my repository showcasing projects developed during my study of fundamental programming concepts at KIU (Kyrgyz International University).

# Overview
These projects represent my journey in mastering programming fundamentals, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java logic, threads, and streams. The implementation of these concepts has provided me with valuable practical experience and a deeper understanding of software development. If you want to check out my projects go to the new-branch and explore my java projects.

# Key Features
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Explore projects where OOP principles are applied, demonstrating a structured and modular approach to software design.

Java Logic: Dive into the logic behind Java programming, understanding and implementing algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

Threads and Streams: Gain insights into concurrent programming with projects that leverage threads for parallel execution and explore the efficient manipulation of data streams.

# Projects
Listed below are the projects included in this repository:

Project 1: [ThreadPool]

Description: Using Threads to do different actions simultaniously.
Project 2: [tempretarus]

Description: Using Streams to manipulate data and filter out different information for various functionalities.


Feel free to explore each project folder for detailed documentation and source code.

# Getting Started
If you are interested in my code, you can download the zip files, extract it and play around with it.

# Acknowledgments
I extend my gratitude to the KIU programming curriculum, which has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of software development. Special thanks to [Ana idadze, helmut seidl] for guidance and support throughout the learning process.

Feel free to reach out for any questions or collaboration opportunities!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
